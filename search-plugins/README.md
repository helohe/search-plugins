Search-Plugins
==============

A collection of privacy-friendly search-plugins for Firefox.
These plugins are generated by `source/opensearch.sh` using the included definitions
and `source/opensearch.xml.in` as template. In order to add them to your Firefox, you
need to open `index.html` over http (`file:///` does not work). The easiest way to
do that, is to execute `python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1` inside this directory
and open `127.0.0.1:8000` in Firefox.
